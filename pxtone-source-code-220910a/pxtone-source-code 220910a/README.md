  --help, -h     Show this dialog.
  --quiet, -q    Omit info & warning messages from console output.
```

## Requirements
 - C++17
 - CMake
 - Ogg
 - Vorbis
 - FLAC
 - libsndfile

No C++ bindings required for any of the libraries
## Building
CMake must be able to find all the libraries within its search paths.
After the prerequisites are met, the following should be fine:

`cmake -B ./build -S ./ && cmake --build ./build`

## Thanks
